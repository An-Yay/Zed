# jZed: My First Interpreter

🚀 Welcome to jZed, My first adventure into the world of creating my own programming language interpreter! 🚀

## What is JZed?

JZed is a high-level programming language designed with the following features:

- **Dynamic Typing**: You won't need to declare variable types explicitly.
- **Automatic Memory Management**: Forget about manual memory management; JZed handles it for you.
- **Standard Library**: Comes with a standard library to make your coding life easier.

## Learning Journey

📚 Here are the key steps in designing and developing a programming language:

1. **Scanning (Lexical Analysis)**: Transforming characters into tokens. Whitespace and other non-essential characters are ignored in this phase.

2. **Parsing**: Transforming tokens into a parse tree (syntax tree) according to the language's grammar.

3. **Syntax Analysis**: Ensuring your code adheres to the language's syntax rules and checking for syntax errors.

4. **Optimizations**: Improving code efficiency with techniques like constant folding.

5. **Intermediate Code Representations**: Translating code into an intermediate format for further processing.

6. **Code Generation**: Generating executable code from the intermediate representation.
